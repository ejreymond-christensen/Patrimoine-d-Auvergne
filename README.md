# Udacity-MapProject

This is my Udacity maps project which displays the major cultural points in the region of Auvergne France. 
Users can use the hamburger menu to view a list of cultural sites and click on the name of marker on the map to get 
interesting info!

## How to use

Simply copy the repo to your desktop and open the index.html file.

## 3rd Party Api

I used flickr's API to append up to 10 photos of the cultural point via the info window.
